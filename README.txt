The project1.py file has a main function with commented out method calls that will run the various tests.  The data is
currently set up for my first classification problem (determining the activity a subject is performing).

The training data is located in:
train_x.csv
train_y_subject.csv
train_y_activity.csv

The test set has both the x and y data in the same file.  The Y values are in the 0 column, the X values begin
in column 1.
XY_test_activity.csv
XY_test_subject.csv

To plot the results use the report_plots.py file.  Uncomment the desired method in the main method.  You will need to
hand input file names into the desired plotting method.
